# MultiBoilerplate release notes

The latest version is 2.0.0, released 2015-03-18.

## Breaking changes <a id="breaking_changes"></a>
* Not compatible with with MW < 1.24 anymore. If you need compatibility to an older version, you
  might have luck with version 1.8.0 of the extension.
* `$wgMultiBoilerplateDiplaySpecialPage` must now be place before the inclusion (`require_once`)
  of the extension, or it will have no effect.

## New features
* Handle `<onlyinclude>` tag in a boilerplate.
* Add support for optgroups (headers) in the dropdown list, by using level 2 headers (==)
  in `MediaWiki:MultiBoilerplate`, thanks to an old patch by an unknown author; see
  [T43788](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T43788) on Phabricator for more details.
* README, RELEASE-NOTES, HISTORY & LICENSE files. 

## Fixes
* Updated to work with MediaWiki >= 1.24
* Refactored to (hopefully) modern MediaWiki extension standards, e.g.:
    * File structure
    * JSON files for l10n
    * Reduce use of globals

## Configuration changes
* See `$wgMultiBoilerplateDiplaySpecialPage` under [Breaking changes](#breaking_changes).
