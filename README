# MultiBoilerplate extension for MediaWiki

The MultiBoilerplate extension allows a boilerplate to be selected from a drop
down box located above the edit form. By default this shows only on creation of
new pages. When loading a boilerplate, it will completely replace whatever text
is already in the edit form.

## Dependencies
Version 2.1.0 and later requires MediaWiki >= 1.25.

## Installation
See the regular installation instructions for MediaWiki extensions:
	https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Extensions#Installing_an_extension

## Configuration

### Main configuration
The main configuration is of the available boilerplates; this is done *either*:
	
* through `$wgMultiBoilerplateOptions` in `LocalSettings.php`, by filling the
  $wgMultiBoilerplateOptions array with a list of boilerplate names that
  correspond to templates, like so:  
  ```$wgMultiBoilerplateOptions[ "My Boilerplate" ] = "Template:My Boilerplate";```
* Or through system message `MediaWiki:Multiboilerplate`, which uses the following
  format:  
  `My Boilerplate|Template:My Boilerplate`  
  You can also create headers to separate boilerplates, for example:
 	
        == Pretty Templates ==
        * My Boilerplate|Template:My Boilerplate
        == Ugly Templates ==
        * Their Boilerplate|Template:Their Boilerplate


### Additional configuration options

* `$wgMultiBoilerplateDiplaySpecialPage`: false by default. if set to true,
  will add to the wiki a page named `Special:MultiBoilerplates` that shows
  the currently configured boilerplates.

* `$wgMultiBoilerplateOverwrite`: false by default. If true, shows the
  boilerplates dropdown even on pre-existing page. The selected boilerplate 
  will completed overwrite the current contents.
